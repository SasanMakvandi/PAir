I, Sasan Makvandi declare that I have not committed an Academic Offence on this assignment.

Specifically:

    I have read the University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters and am aware of what constitutes plagiarism.
    No code other than my own (plus starter code) has been submitted.
    I have not received any pieces of code from others (including test cases).
    I have not obtained pieces of code available publicly, nor modified such code to pass as my own work.
    I have not shared any parts of my code with others (including test cases), nor shared specific details on how others may reproduce similar code.
    I did not instruct another classmate on what to write in their assignment code.
    I did not receive instruction on specifically what to write in my code, and have come up with the solution myself
    I did not look for assignment solutions online.
    I did not attend private tutoring sessions (including in other languages) which are not explicitly sanctioned by UTM where the assignment was discussed.
    I did not post my own code publicly online on places like GitHub, pastebin, StackOverflow, etc.
    I acknowledge that this declaration is truthful and does not include any misrepresentation. I acknowledge that not being able to explain in detail my own work will result in a zero on this assignment, and that if the code is detected to be plagiarized, severe academic penalties will be applied when the case is brought forward to the Dean.
